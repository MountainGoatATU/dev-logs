## Agenda
- Change API to embed vault into user model
- Showcase front-end UI work
--- 
## Notes
- [[sprint7]] started
- Possibly change email + password + master password flow to just email + master password, no account password?
---
## Decisions
- Merge vault into user model
- Use email + master password to authenticate instead of email + account password
	- Create vault salt and auth salt
	- Create KDF for vault AND auth with separate salts
	- Store salts and hashed auth KDF
	- All client-side derivation
