# Keyboard shortcuts
## Requirements
- Keyboard shortcuts should use a combination of two or more keys by default.
- Include a tutorial, list, or help center page of all custom keyboard shortcuts in your product. For example, Cmd+Z (Ctrl+Z) to undo deleting an event in Google Calendar.
- If a keyboard shortcut is activated with a single key, provide users with a way to take at least one of these actions:
    - **(Most preferred)** Remap the shortcut to include one or more non-printable keyboard keys.
    - **(Preferred)** Activate the shortcut only when a relevant component is focused.
    - **(Not preferred, only use as a temporary solution)** Turn off the keyboard shortcut.
