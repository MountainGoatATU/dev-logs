## Salt 
A sequence of **randomly generated bytes** (commonly 16 bytes) added to a password before hashing.
- Ensures that even if two users or vaults share the same password, their derived keys (hashes) are unique
- Must be unique per password or vault, but does not need to be secret
## **Argon2id**
A **password hashing function (PHF)** that can also serve as a **key derivation function (KDF).**
- **Inputs:** Password, Salt, and optional secret (pepper)
- **Outputs:** A _derived key_ (hash) of configurable length
- **Parameters:**
    - `time_cost` — number of iterations (controls CPU effort)
    - `memory_cost` — amount of memory used (resists GPU/ASIC attacks)
    - `parallelism` — number of threads/lanes
    - `output_length` — length of the derived key in bytes
    - Optional `pepper` — an application-wide secret stored separately (e.g. in an environment variable)
## Derived Key
The **output** of a Key Derivation Function such as Argon2id.
- Acts as a **key** used for encryption, decryption, or authentication
- Deterministically generated from the same password + salt (+ pepper + parameters)
## Hash
A **fixed-length output** produced by a hashing algorithm.
- In password storage contexts, 'hash' refers to the **derived key** output of a PHF/KDF (e.g. Argon2id)
## AES-256
**Advanced Encryption Standard** using a **256-bit key**.
- A **symmetric encryption algorithm**, meaning the same key is used for both encryption and decryption
- Common modes of operation:
    - **GCM:** provides both **encryption and authentication**, producing an **authentication tag**
## ChaCha20
A **stream cipher** designed as a faster, modern alternative to **AES** on systems without hardware acceleration.
- Uses a **256-bit key** and a **96-bit nonce**
	- **XChaCha20** uses a **192-bit nonce**
- When combined with **Poly1305** (as in **ChaCha20-Poly1305**), it provides **authenticated encryption (AEAD)**
## Nonce
Short for **"number used once"**.
- A **unique value per encryption operation** — typically 12-24 bytes
- Ensures that encrypting the same plaintext with the same key produces different ciphertexts
- Must be **unique per key**, but doesn’t have to be secret
- Used by both **AES-GCM** and **ChaCha20-Poly1305** to generate unique keystreams
## Encrypted Blob
A **binary large object** that contains the encrypted form of data, often stored in databases or files.
- Usually includes:
    - The **ciphertext** (encrypted data)
    - The **nonce** (used during encryption)
    - The **authentication tag** (for integrity verification)
    - Possibly metadata like algorithm, key version, or salt
## Authentication Tag
A short cryptographic value (often 16 bytes) used to **verify data integrity and authenticity**.
- Produced by **AEAD (Authenticated Encryption with Associated Data)** algorithms like AES-GCM or ChaCha20-Poly1305.
- Ensures that the ciphertext and any associated data **haven’t been tampered with**.
- During decryption, the tag is recalculated and compared — if it doesn’t match, decryption fails.
